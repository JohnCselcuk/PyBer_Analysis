## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create data frame and find out the results that will show us ride sharing data by cities. There where tree city’s that we have evaluated in this analysis Rural, Urban and Suburban. We evaluate 6 months period in this analysis 2019 January to 2019 May. We have used Python libraries Pandas and Matplotlib; a summary chart for each city type's totals and averages was produced. Also, we have gotten results by following criteria; show total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and total weekly fares for each city type. We have created a multiple line graph, scatter plots, bubble charts and pie charts. To complete this analysis we have used several different functions an example; groupby, count, type, format, index etc…

## Results
PyBer ride-sharing data was combined from city_data.csv and ride_data.csv files, in order to produce a summary of Total Ride, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average fare per ride, and Average Fare per Driver.

We have created multiple-line chart for this analysis, we are able to compare total fares by city type over a period of five months. The number of rides looks like peak at the end of February and fluctuates during the month of March. At the April we can see that Urban and Suburban city’s getting lowest results, Rural city stays close to same as mount of march.
